The syntax you're using is called a **Heredoc** in PHP.

---

### ✅ What is `<<<product`?

This is **Heredoc syntax** — used to write **multi-line strings** in PHP **without using quotes** or complex escaping.

```php
echo <<<product
   ...multiline HTML/PHP string...
product;
```

* `<<<product` is the **start** of the heredoc.
* `product;` (must be on a new line and not indented) is the **end** marker — it tells PHP where the heredoc block ends.

---

### ✅ Rules of Heredoc in PHP:

1. **Start with `<<<IDENTIFIER`** — you can use any name (e.g., `HTML`, `EOD`, `product`, etc.).
2. The end marker **must match exactly** (same case), and:

   * Must be the **only thing** on that line.
   * **No spaces or tabs** before or after it.
3. Inside the block:

   * **Variables are parsed**, like `$fetch[name]`.
   * You can write **HTML**, **JavaScript**, or long text easily.

### 🔴 Mistakes to Avoid

```php
echo <<<product
  ...
 product;   // ❌ wrong: has space or is not aligned left
```

Correct:

```php
echo <<<product
  ...
product;
```

---

### ✅ Example Simplified

```php
$name = "Sandeep";

echo <<<HTML
  <h1>Hello, $name!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to PHP heredoc.</p>
HTML;
```

---

Yes, you **can use the same name** as the heredoc identifier (like `product`) **inside `<td>` or anywhere within the HTML** — **no problem at all**.

---

### ✅ Example:

```php
echo <<<product
<tr>
  <td>Product</td>  <!-- ✅ OK to use the word 'Product' -->
  <td>$fetch[name]</td>
</tr>
product;
```

The heredoc identifier (`product`) is just a **marker for the beginning and end** of a block — it doesn't interfere with text inside.

---

### 🔴 Important Rule:

Only avoid **accidentally breaking the end marker**. For example:

```php
product;  // ✅ This must be on its own line with no spaces before or after
```

If you accidentally write:

```php
  product; // ❌ has space → causes syntax error
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Can you use the word "product" inside `<td>` or HTML? | ✅ Yes |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Can heredoc end marker (`product;`) have spaces?      | ❌ No  |
| Must it be exactly the same name (case-sensitive)?    | ✅ Yes |
